# System Programming

This repository contains the assignments for the course System Programming (k24) of DIT-NKUA.

__Project 1__ is an implementation of a graph using hashing.

__Project 2__ is about process creation (fork/exec), interprocess communication(named-pipes) and low level I/O.

__Project 3__ is about creating, synchronizing and assign specific jobs to threads. 
Also has been implemented a data structure based on a hashtable and mechanisms to achieve mutual exclusion to avoid race conditions(mutexes). 
Furthermore there are used sockets for communication between server/client apps.
