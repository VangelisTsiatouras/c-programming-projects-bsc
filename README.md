# C Programming Projects B.Sc.

This repository contains some old work of mine when I was undergraduate student at University of Athens. 
These projects are mainly proof-of-concepts of some computer science problems, such as implementing B+ Trees 
from scratch, Bloom Filters, Linear Hashing and even using parallel computing.
